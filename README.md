# AlgorithmProjects
Projects from CS340 Data Structures and Algorithms.

The First Project uses 3 sorts, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort.
The Second Project searches using Binary Search Trees and Red-Black Trees.
The Third Project uses Depth First Search for Topologically Sorting a Graph
The Fourth Project uses Primms Algorithm and Kruskals Algorithm for Min Spanning Trees.
The Fifth Project uses Bellman Ford Algorithm, DAG Shortest Path, and Dijkstra's Alogrithm to Find Shortest Path of a Graph.
There is a bug in Dijkstra's Algorthim causing it to work unconsistently.
